Uses effective and efficient methods of teaching while focusing on the individual needs of each student.          Highlights          Central Missouri Math Educators club member  Missouri Council of Teachers of Mathematics 2014 Conference      Tutoring experience  MS Office proficient  Organized   Timely             Accomplishments     While working for Beauty Brands I received two awards. I received the Award of Excellence and Shift Manager of the Year. The Award of Excellence is a company wide award and is awarded to one person from each district. Out of seven locations I was chosen for my district. I was presented the award at Beauty Brands annual banquet in Kansas City. I accepted the award from the founder and CEO and was recognized in front of all of home office, location managers, and other award winners. The next year I was awarded with Shift Manager of the Year for my district.         Experience     I have a little over 100 hours of observation and participation field experience. Sixty hours of my field experience are observations from algebra I at Lees Summit High School summer school and 6th grade math and social studies at Brittany Hill. Fifteen hours were spent at Holden Middle School tutoring 6th through 8th graders in various contents. I spent twelve hours observing special education students in both a general education and special education classrooms. I finished about twenty hours in a 6th grade math class at Grain Valley South Middle School. One of my peers and I taught three different lessons and led several small groups in discussions about various math articles. One lesson we taught was reviewing order of operations. Since the students were newly familiar with the information we wanted them to get some practice working on various problems using multiple operations. We played â€œI have, who has?â€ As each student read their equation to the class I would write it on the board so that they could visualize it and write it down. Students would call out the answer when it was their card and then we solved the problem on the board as a class before we moved on to the next card. The students really enjoyed this because it was something that we did all together and they saw it as more of a game and thought it was fun.

Sixty hours of my field experience are observations from algebra I at Lees Summit High School summer school and 6th grade math and social studies at Brittany Hill. Fifteen hours were spent at Holden Middle School tutoring 6th through 8th graders in various contents. I spent twelve hours observing special education students in both a general education and special education classrooms. I finished about twenty hours in a 6th grade math class at Grain Valley South Middle School. One of my peers and I taught three different lessons and led several small groups in discussions about various math articles. One lesson we taught was reviewing order of operations. Since the students were newly familiar with the information we wanted them to get some practice working on various problems using multiple operations. We played â€œI have, who has?â€ As each student read their equation to the class I would write it on the board so that they could visualize it and write it down. Students would call out the answer when it was their card and then we solved the problem on the board as a class before we moved on to the next card. The students really enjoyed this because it was something that we did all together and they saw it as more of a game and thought it was fun. </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=""section"" id=""SECTION_EXPR546182682"" style=""

Changed Marinette Marine Module Construction from a static build process to a dynamic build process resulting in schedule attainment and a productivity improvement from 50% to 100%. Â The resulting cost improvement has netted savings of $5M per ship.  Lead, Designed, Constructed and Operated a new Module Facility resulting in achievement of baseline schedules and operations at budgeted cost. Â Achieved this despite many claims that the process design would never work and it would cost us more to operate in this fashion.  Helped grow a small, privately owned company from $8M in revenue to $20M in revenue in a very competitive market. Â Performed this through Lean engagement, Customer Involvement, Employee involvement and drive to achieve the goals we collectively set.  Worked all aspects of Thermasys Corporation until my final role of VP/GM. Â During this time, I implemented Lean methods that lead to significant improvements in cost, schedule, quality and safety.        Professional Experience      Director of Ship Construction   07/2015   to   Current     Company Name   City  ,   State       Accountable for Ship Completion prior to launch including Fabrication, Assembly, Paint, Outfitting, Testing, and System completion.  Responsibilities include Ship Construction from First Plate Cut to the Launch of the Ship, Management of Cost and Schedule performance and achievement of Strategic Corporate Goals.  Additional responsibilities include Relationship Building with the Union Membership and Collective Bargaining Unit and Negotiations with the Union regarding upcoming Contract renewal.  Span of control includes 4 ships in various stages of construction, oversight of over 850 Union employees and 61 Area Managers, General Foremen and Foremen.  Lean Methods:  Instrumental in the introduction and implementation of Lean methods.  Results to date include: Lean re-organization of the external areas of the shipyard including removing multiple locations of identical activities reducing travel 		time and creating a much more productive workforce by providing support and resources at Point of Use.  Implementation of Barcoding and improved inventory of materials and equipment for reductions of material loss and quick 	identification of material location for quick response to demand.          Director of Outfitting   07/2014   to   06/2015     Company Name   City  ,   State       Accountable for Ship Completion prior to launch including Outfitting, Testing, and System completion.  Responsibilities included Structural Completion and Module Erection; Insuring all Pipe, Electrical, Insulation, Equipment, and Propulsion Systems are complete and prepared for the next stage of final construction and System testing.  Span of control includes 4 ships in various stages of construction, oversight of over 600 Union employees and 42 Area Managers, General Foremen and Foremen.  Insuring that all Outfitting is done in its sequenced Stage of Construction.  In June 2014, our completion rate of modules prior to module erection was roughly 65%. Â It is now in the high 90 percentile and averages 97%.  My Team raised the bar for the level of completion at the time of launch. Â Prior ships launched at a level of mid - low 70 percentile, while LCS 9 launched at 84% complete and therefore re-gaining schedule for an on-time delivery.  This level of completion earned the Team significant accolades from the customer along with the company earning a multi-million dollar incentive bonus for achieving this goal  Introduced status boards at Work Centers to communicate performance to employees.  Additionally, we post safety alerts on status boards when accidents occur and speak to each of our crews to insure we are adhering to safe practices and alerting Leadership when they see a problem.          Director of Fabrication and Assembly   11/2012   to   06/2014     Company Name   City  ,   State       Accountable for the Construction of Modules for LCS vessels.  Responsible for the following; Structure, Pipe Fabrication, Outfitting of equipment and Electrical foundations, short and long term manning plans, and cost and schedule performance.  The Structural Trade (Steel and Aluminum) was performing at 50% productivity and losing schedule each day. Â Additionally, the team was disjointed and not working as a cohesive unit.  Throughout the transition from poor performance to exceptional performance, I accomplished the following:  1) Immediately cut manning in the Steel Module department from 167 down to 127, with immediate improvement in cost performance and no degradation in schedule. Â 2) Continued to reduce manning through attrition and the elimination of contract employees to achieve on budget cost performance. Â 3) Once stabilized, schedule performance began to improve until the group was back on baseline schedule and improvements began to happen daily. Â 4) Built a solid Team that has continued to improve and is currently operating with 70 employees as opposed 167 and continues to gain schedule and make improvements.  Spearheaded the introduction and implementation of Lean methods.  Results to date include: Implemented 5S program with great success.Everything has a place; Everything in it's place.  Implemented Lean methods in the Pipe shop that resulted in an increased throughput from 250 spools per week 			up to just over 400 spools per week without additional manpower.  Introduced status boards at Work Centers to communicate performance to employee base.  Introduced daily tracking, progressing and daily status to each foreman in an effort to understand how we 			performed each day and what corrections must be made to insure we meet our weekly goals.  As this group stabilized, complaints from our internal customers diminished by 75%.  This was done through open communication of the down stream issues with internal customers and a ""Go and See"" technique so the foreman who performed the unacceptable work could understand how their error effected down stream operations.  Using this technique, coupled with a more clear understanding of quality procedures, quality performance improved greatly saving thousands of hours of unnecessary rework.  Highlighting safety as the most important thing we do as a Leadership Team and working with my direct reports, we managed to create a safer, cleaner and more organized environment, reducing accidents by 50 % in the first year.  This was accomplished through communication and implementation of 5S methods leading to eliminating potential safety hazards.          Director of Outfitting   06/2012   to   11/2012     Company Name   City  ,   State       Accountable for Ship Completion prior to launch including Outfitting, Testing, System completion.  Responsibilities included Structural Completion and Module Erection; Insuring all Pipe, Electrical, Insulation, Equipment, Propulsion Systems were complete and prepared for the next stage of final construction and System testing.  Key strategy in this role was the primary focus on Lean Implementations and Team Building.  During first 5 months at Marinette Marine, I introduced the organization to Lean Methods and began implementing new techniques; predominantly 5S activities.  Instrumental in the introduction and implementation of Lean methods.  Results to date include: Implemented a staging and organization of all Rigging tools and equipment to prevent losses and hours lost 			searching for the necessary tools.  To date, significant hours of time have been saved as a result of the elimination 			searching for tools and equipment for rigging major lifts, module moves and module erections.  Implemented a staging and organization of all safety equipment to prevent the loss and searching for safety 			stantions, line and lead trellis' and other safety related equipment.  Results lead to the reduction of accidents 			related to lack of safety chains, stations, and lead control.
